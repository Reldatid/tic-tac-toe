## Brief:

Create an implementation of tic tac toe in a webpage.

### Technical Requirements
Your app must:

- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript with jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

So I may have disobeyed the "KISS" rule, and implemented something I've kinda wanted to build ever since I was introduced to it. It was shown to me as Tic-Tac-Toe-Ten, as there are 10 boards, 1 in each of the 9 segments of the larger master board.

### Full Ruleset
- The aim is to get 3 in a row in the big board.
- To claim a square on the big board you must win the contained small board.
- Player one can go in any square.
- Each move dictates in which sub-board the next turn takes place. e.g - playing in the top left of a small board means the next turn must happen in the top left of the containing board.
- If a smaller board is won, it belongs to that player and su subsequent turns can happen in that board.
- If a turn is directed towards a claimed cell on a board, the player can then go anywhere else on that board.
